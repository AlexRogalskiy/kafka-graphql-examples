# Node.js implementation

## Running

For now just building to run the cluster with the master branch, and connect loccaly to the docker cluster. Use `npm start` to start.

## TODO
- Complete GraphQL endpoint and likely remove the whole app.ts, add a cache for the mutation
- Dockerize
- Test against the other implementations
